From yarn initialization:
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start
    Starts the development server so you can open your app in the Expo
    app on your phone.

  yarn run ios
    (Mac only, requires Xcode)
    Starts the development server and loads your app in an iOS simulator.

  yarn run android
    (Requires Android build tools)
    Starts the development server and loads your app on a connected Android
    device or emulator.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd GPAPlanner
  yarn start

Happy hacking!

For this project you'll need node and yarn, as well as at least Android Studio

to get all packages configured, just run 'yarn' in the GPAPlanner directory
